# Random_walk

In the random wealk problem one takes each steps randomly. Say one would move along a line and each step would be taken based on a coin toss.
If it's a head one would move forward and if it's a tale one would move backward.
And after sometime say 100 sec we'd see where they ends up.
If we repeat the whole thing long enough, we'd be able to count the probability.


Interestingly the result that we get is a Gaussian curve with its peak at the 0 position.
That means if we take the ensambled probability of being somewhere after sometime in a random walk one would always find themselves around the zero position.
