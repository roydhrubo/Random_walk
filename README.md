# Random_walk

In the random wealk problem one takes each steps randomly. Say one would move along a line and each step would be taken based on a coin toss.
If it's a head one would move forward and if it's a tale one would move backward.
And after sometime say 100 sec we'd count the probability of being somewhere.

Interestingly the result that we get is a Gaussian curve with its peak at the 0 position.
That means if we take the ensambled probability of being somewhere after sometime in a random walk one would always find themselves around the zero position.
